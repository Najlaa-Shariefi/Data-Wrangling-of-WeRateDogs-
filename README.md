# Overview 
Data Wrangling includes Gathering, Assessing and Cleaning of data. The data for this project was gathered from twitter API using the tweet id provided by Udacity and tweepy package in python. The JSON data gathered from tweepy was read as pandas dataframe then various visual and programtic assessments were performed to determine multiple quality and tidiness issues. A subset of issues(31 Quality and 3 Tidiness) were addressed using various techniques in pandas and finally few insights were disscussed.
